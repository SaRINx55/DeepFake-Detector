# DeepFake-Detector
This notebook is my final kernel in the #DFDC challenge hosted on Kaggle. Uses PyTorch framework
I've used BlazeFace Detector to detect faces in the video and then used a ConvNet (ResNeXT).
Note, this notebook achieved a public score of 0.46559 and a private score of 0.56206, and was placed in the TOP 29%.
It is also to be noted that this notebook *may* not work in real life due to the nature of dataset (FaceForensic++) provided.

#update 1
An improved version of the detector is in progress and will be updated
